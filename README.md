# SAWViz

This week I tried to figure out how to create a self-avoiding walk which was fully filled in a M by N matrix. 
Try the DEMO [HERE](https://rebeccazhou666.github.io/SAWViz/).

This constraint is a special case of the original self-avoiding walk, which limited the steps to exact M*N in a given M by N lattice. 
I wrote the code inspired by the idea of [Hamiltonian path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path). The advantage was that it was easy to understand, yet it sacrificed the computational complexity. Details will come soon.

I keep investigating the javascript realization of pivot algorithm for self-avoiding walk. Will keep posting on this Page.
